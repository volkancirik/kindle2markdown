a gigantic brain, prodigiously well-developed and several million years in advance of our own civilization, a sort of 'cosmic yogi,' a sage, a symbol of omniscience, which had long ago understood the vanity of all action and for this reason had retreated into an unbreakable silence.

Was it possible for thought to exist without consciousness? Could one, in any case, apply the word thought to the processes observed in the ocean? Is a mountain only a huge stone? Is a planet an enormous mountain?

We are humanitarian and chivalrous; we don't want to enslave other races, we simply want to bequeath them our values and take over their heritage in exchange.

We have no need of other worlds. We need mirrors. We don't know what to do with other worlds.

"I don't know of any religion that answers your description. That kind of religion has never been … necessary. If I understand you, and I'm afraid I do, what you have in mind is an evolving god, who develops in the course of time, grows, and keeps increasing in power while remaining aware of his powerlessness. For your god, the divine condition is a situation without a goal. And understanding that, he despairs. But isn't this despairing god of yours mankind, Kelvin? It is man you are talking about, and that is a fallacy, not just philosophically but also mystically speaking."

"I don't know. It seems quite feasible to me. That is the only god I could imagine believing in, a god whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfils no purpose—a god who simply is."

My high school English teacher used to say that when you conclude a paper, you should always close a door and open a window; the door you’re closing is the issue at hand, which you should have resolved, and\
 the window is the set of questions you’ve raised and prospects for future research.^M

impairing people’s ability to construct embodied simulations interferes with their ability to understand language about visual or motor content, which implies that simulation does something.^M

brain systems dedicated to perception play a functional role in language processing—losing the ability to use parts of the brain devoted to processing spatial relations impedes correctly using language abou\
t spatial relations but not necessarily other types of language.^M
