#Convert Kindle Clippings to Markdown Format for blogging

In order to add your comments & quotes using your Kindle Clippings to your markdown flavoured
pages, use this script.

A sample clippings file is added. Just run:

    python clippings2markdown.py sampleClippings.txt

Follow the commands and add your comments. It will generate an `Title-Author-comments.md`
file with quotes and comments.

TODO:
- Add a better readme file.
